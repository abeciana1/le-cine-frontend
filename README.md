<h2>Why?</h2>
Since the start of the pandemic, like many of us, I found myself with less of a social life. In the early days, when most wouldnâ€™t dare step outside of their homes, people needed to find ways to entertain themselves while in quarantine.

<br />
Thankfully, my friend Russell found this as an opportunity to create a safe escape once a week in the form of the Pandemic Film Club. We have all cultivated a lasting friendship that spans across the country.

<h1>Design and Art</h1>

Bauhaus was created in 1919 in Weimar, Germany after WWI. Bauhaus' objectives were to unify art, craft, and technology using the three universal basic shapes and colors:
<ul>
    <li>The dynamic triangle is inherently yellow.</li>
    <li>The static square is intrinsically red.</li>
    <li>The serene circle is naturally blue.</li>
</ul>

One hundred years ago, this art form was created to bring solidarity and unity in the world. I chose to use this design theory in Le Cine because the world needs solidarity more than ever before.
