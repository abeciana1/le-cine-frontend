<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
Since the start of the pandemic, like many of us, I found myself with less of a social life. In the early days, when most wouldnâ€™t dare step outside of their homes, people needed to find ways to entertain themselves while in quarantine.
<br />
<br />
Although we have to socially distance, it didn't mean we couldn't expand digital forms of socializing. Thankfully, my friend Russell found this as an opportunity to create a safe escape once a week in the form of the Pandemic Film Club. We have all cultivated a lasting friendship that spans across the country.
<br />
<br />
Films have always been a way to fantasize and escape from reality for a short amount of time. The creation of a film club does not only provide an opportunity for people to watch a film, it allows them to analyze, discuss, and share ideas with other people. For instance, in my friend Russell's Pandemic Film Club, we take turns hosting themed double-features. The preparation and homework each week gives that night's host something to look at, read, and interact with in a creative environment. The discussion questions for the "homework" film forces us to take our minds away from the pandemic and into something constructive. The "watchalong" film is a chance for us to share a movie that can be enjoyed and discussed afterwards.

<h4>Hosting a Club</h4>

As a host of a club, you will notice that certain components will appear on the app for you. For instance, on your club's show page, only you can update the club, disband the club (as long as the member list is empty), and create a meeting (a modal form will open).

On the "Member List" page allows you to contact members via email individually or all of them as a group. You can also remove any of the members from the club.

On the club's watchlist page, only you can remove a film.

On the club's meetings page, you choose to remove/delete a meeting from the page. Similar to a regular member, you can click "View Details" to open the meeting's show page. Now, you can update details about the meeting and/or add movies for discussion or watchalong to the meeting.

<h2 id="bauhaus">About Bauhaus Design</h2>

Bauhaus was created in 1919 in Weimar, Germany after WWI. The Bauhaus School's objectives were to unify art, craft, and technology using the three universal basic shapes and colors:

<ul>
    <li>The dynamic triangle is inherently yellow.</li>
    <li>The static square is intrinsically red.</li>
    <li>The serene circle is naturally blue.</li>
</ul>

One hundred years ago, this art form was created to bring solidarity and unity in the world. Unfortunately, the school only lasted 14 years before being closed by Nazis for not being fascist. However, this stop the founder of Bauhaus from spreading their ideas of unity in the world. As they escaped and settled in other countries, they influenced other artists and art forms. Bauhaus is more than an art on a canvas or website, it has been used design everything from furniture to buildings.
<br />
<br />
I chose to use this design theory in Le Cine because the world needs solidarity and unity more than ever before.
